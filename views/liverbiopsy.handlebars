        <td>With a liver biopsy (BYE-op-see), the<br>
        physician is able to examine a small piece<br>
        of tissue from your liver for signs of<br>
        damage or disease. This procedure<br>
        involves using a special needle to remove<br>
        tissue from the liver. The physician<br>
        decides to do a liver biopsy after tests<br>
        suggest that the liver does not work<br>
        properly. For example, a blood test<br>
        might show that your blood contains<br>
        higher than normal levels of liver<br>
        enzymes or too much iron or copper. An<br>
        x-ray could suggest that the liver is<br>
        swollen. Looking at liver tissue itself is<br>
        the best way to determine whether the<br>
        liver is healthy. <br>
        <br>
        Preparation<br>
        <br>
        Before scheduling your biopsy, the<br>
        physician will take blood samples to<br>
        make sure your blood clots properly. Be<br>
        sure to mention any medications you<br>
        take, especially those, like blood<br>
        thinners, that affect blood clotting. One<br>
        week before the surgery, you will have<br>
        to stop taking aspirin, ibuprofen, and<br>
        anticoagulants. You will also have a<br>
        chest x-ray. <br>
        <br>
        You must not eat or drink anything for 8<br>
        hours before the biopsy, and you should<br>
        plan to arrive at the hospital about an<br>
        hour before the scheduled time of the<br>
        surgery. Your physician will tell you<br>
        whether to take your normal medications</td>

during the fasting period and may give you other special
instructions. <br>

<br>
<strong>Procedure<br>
</strong><br>
Liver biopsy is considered minor surgery and is done at the
hospital. The nurse will start<br>
an intravenous line to give you medication for the procedure. For
the biopsy, you will lie<br>
on a hospital bed on your back or turned slightly to the left
side, with your right hand<br>
above your head. After marking the outline of your liver and
injecting a local anesthetic to<br>
numb the area, the physician will make a small incision in your
right side near your rib<br>
cage, then insert the biopsy needle and retrieve a sample of
liver tissue. In some cases, the<br>
physician may use an ultrasound image of the liver to help guide
the needle to a specific<br>
spot. <br>
<br>
You will need to hold very still so that the physician does not
nick the lung or gallbladder,<br>
which are close to the liver. The physician will ask you to hold
your breath for 5 to 10<br>
seconds while he or she puts the needle in your liver. You may
feel a dull pain. The entire<br>
procedure takes about 20 minutes. <br>
<br>
Two other methods of liver biopsy are also available. For a
laparoscopic biopsy, the<br>
physician inserts a special tube called a laparoscope through an
incision in the abdomen.<br>
The laparoscope sends images of the liver to a monitor. The
physician watches the monitor<br>
and uses instruments in the laparoscope to remove tissue samples
from one or more parts<br>
of the liver. Physicians use this type of biopsy when they need
tissue samples from<br>
specific parts of the liver. <br>
<br>
Transvenous biopsy involves inserting a tube called a catheter
into a vein in the neck and<br>
guiding it to the liver. The physician puts a biopsy needle into
the catheter and then into the<br>
liver. Physicians use this procedure when patients have
blood-clotting problems or fluid in<br>
the abdomen. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Recovery<br>
<br>
After the biopsy, the physician will put a bandage over the
incision and have you lie on<br>
your right side, pressed against a towel, for at least 2 hours.
The nurse will monitor your<br>
vital signs and level of pain. You may remain in the hospital for
up to 24 hours after the<br>
surgery to recover from the sedative and to allow the medical
staff to check you for<br>
complications before sending you home. <br>
<br>
You will need to arrange to have someone take you home from the
hospital since you will<br>
not be allowed to drive after having the sedative. You must go
directly home and remain in<br>
bed (except to use the bathroom) for 8 to 12 hours, depending on
your physician's<br>
instructions. Also, be sure not to exert yourself too much for
the next week so that the<br>
incision and liver can heal. You can expect a little soreness at
the incision site, and you<br>
might have some pain in your right shoulder. This pain is caused
by irritation of the<br>
diaphragm muscle (the pain usually radiates to the shoulder) and
should disappear within a<br>
few hours or days. Your physician may recommend that you take
Tylenol for pain, but<br>
you must not take aspirin or ibuprofen for the first week after
surgery. These medicines<br>
decrease blood clotting, which is crucial for healing. <br>
<br>
Like any surgery, liver biopsy does have some risks, such as
puncture of the lung or<br>
gallbladder, infection, bleeding, and pain, but these
complications are rare. </p>
